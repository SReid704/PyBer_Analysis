# PyBer_Analysis
Exploratory Analysis for PyBer
## Overview 

PyBer Rideshare Company needed an analysis conducted as well as visualizations to analyze the relationship between urban, suburban, and rural cities. There are two types of data used which is the number of drivers and riders; as well as determining the percentage of riders and drivers in total based off of city type. Using the matplotlib library we have produced results and provided visualizations based on each city type.
## Results
Merged Datasets with city column to use for analysis. Please see insights below:
- Based off the visualization below Urban cities has the highest total rides and total drivers.
- The average fare per driver for Rural cities are higher than the average fare per driver in Urban cities.
- Rural cities has under 80 total drivers compared to suburban cities totaling almost 500

## Summary
### Recommendations based of Exploratory Analysis

1. There is a very high number of drivers in the urban areas. These drivers are not producing enough rides. There is 2,405 drivers and only 1,625 rides.      By reducing the amount of drivers; the average fare per driver will increase bringing the company in additional revenue. All the drivers will get enough rides instead of no rides at all.
2. Rural areas have a high average fare per Driver compared to the rural and suburban areas. Rural areas may need more drivers. This will allow you to gain additional rides in the rural area.
3. In rural and suburban areas there is not much demand. Offering discounts during specific times of the day could increase rides in teh rural areas.
